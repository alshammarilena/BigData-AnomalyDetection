## BigData-AnomalyDetection
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in environmental sensor data using *PySpark* and *Machine Learning models*.  
It was developed as part of a Big Data course at Princess Nourah University (PNU).  
---
## Dataset
- *Size:* 405,000+ IoT sensor records  
- *Features:* CO, Smoke, LPG, Temperature, Humidity, Motion, Light  
- *Goal:* Identify anomalies caused by sensor errors or real environmental changes  
---
## Methods & Models
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with PySpark  
- Outlier detection using IQR & Standard Deviation  
- Classification Models:  
  - Decision Tree 
  - Random Forest  
  - Logistic Regression 
---
## Results
- All models achieved *98% accuracy*  
- *Random Forest* performed best in balancing recall & precision  
- Strong correlation found between CO, Smoke, and LPG sensors
